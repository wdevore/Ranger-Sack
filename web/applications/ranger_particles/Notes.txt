Working: ------------------------------------------------
Add pulsing to Variance such that a variance acts for a certain period
of time.

Motion blur can be obtained from clearing the background with an
alpha value (0,0,0, 0.2)

Add max particles field.
  

Howto to control infinity:
  We need a boolean system that drives a set of Functions.
  The downside is that the combinations become unweldy.
  
  For ex: if a user enables Rotation, Scale then we switch to the
  RotationScale Function driver. 1) init driver 2) run driver.  
  
Save and load to local storage...
When the app exits it checks to see what maps haven't been saved anywhere.

emit towards mouse location

implement fps control

- Be able to control distribution of variance. does it lean towards the
max or min?

Basic particle system...
  Most properties have a variance that accompanies them. For example
  Lifetime +- a variance. The variance has a scaler to control the
  magnitude of the variance from.
  Some variances operate once during the intial emission.
  Some variance can operate during the lifetime. For example, scale could
  vary over the lifetime.

Live preview area:
Has overlays that can be turned on/off:
  A direction stick with a handle can be dragged.
  A rectangle can be drawn out.
A grid in background
A checkered background pattern
The particle system can be dragged. 
Checkbox to control if particles die when exiting canvas.

Emitters tab
  Stored in local-storage including most recently active.
  
Emitter properties tab

Requirements: -------------------------------------------
Load (Local/GDrive):
  - load json
  - load zip
  - load images (visual, influence map)
Save (GDrive):
  - save json
  - save zip

embed images into json (base64 encoding)
Templates/Presets
Shapes (SVG or Image or Paths)
Particles spawning sub-particles.

GUI:
  Live Canvas display
  Background color picker (popup or color grid)
  FPS, Living count
  Independent (particles are children or independent)
  Continous or 1-shot
  Image alignment (images rotates or is axis aligned)
  Drag particle system (constrained to div)
  
Rendering:
  Composites (add, subtract etc...)
